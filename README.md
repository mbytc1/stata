# Stata functions
This repository contains self-authored stata functions (mostly for use in genomics analysis). 
You may get some additional use out of them.
They were written primarily to work on Linux using STATA 13.1 MP (xstata). I have been working on adjusting them the work on a Windows Standalone machine.

The following pages will hopefully be useful in helping you utilise these programs / code-snippets.
